Ryan, also known as sgoblin, is head of the website team, and joined the class because ROVs are interesting. He loves Linux and reads Linux Journal (which is considered by the NSA to be an extremist forum. He is also a hypocrite, as he is writing this on a Windows 8 laptop, although he often uses cloud (and Linux) based development environments to get around the shortcomings of Windows. His custom built home computer is approximately 10 years old, runs Lubuntu, has a dual-core, 2 GHz processor, 4 GB of RAM, and a horrible graphics card, and runs most things at the same speed, or faster, than his HP Envy i7 Quad-Core 3.something GHz, 12 GB RAM, and great graphics card laptop. This gives Google the information that they need to NOT target him with ads for HP Envy laptops, or in fact any computer that has Windows 8 on it! sgoblin has the longest bio of the ROV team...
