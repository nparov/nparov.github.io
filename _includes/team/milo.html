Hi, I am Milo W.[Last name removed for privacy]. Science is a wonder that I will always pursue. I <a href="http://www.usc.edu/CSSF/History/2013/pictures/Portrait/35936.html">won my category</a> at the state science fair [in 2013]. I am going to stop acting fat headed; I really just joined this club to have fun.
