In a galaxy far, far away, Ian Long embarked on a glorious adventure to NPA school of Jedi Masters. Ian realized that the force has introduced him to ROV (standing for Remote Operating Vehicle). Ian became very interested, because the majority of padawan electives had to do with performing. Ian was introduced to a droid specified for underwater. Ian was a techy who had tons of techy Imperial industrious technology. He was interested in building robots that would once be FULLY OPERATIONAL!
